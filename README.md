A repository to kickstart mkebiclioglu's Github.

Hey everyone,

I am a data analyst for the Go-to-Market team at PatientPop. I work with SQL, Pandas and Salesforce. Currently residing in Boston, MA.

My goal is to be a Full Stack Engineer by developing my skills in programing in the next few months. I am currently utilizing freeCodeCamp and spend about +3 hrs each day learning.
